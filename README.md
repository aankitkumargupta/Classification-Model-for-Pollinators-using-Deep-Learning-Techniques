Deep Learning Image Classifier from Scratch
This repository presents a comprehensive exploration into building a robust image classifier using advanced deep learning techniques. The project focuses on classifying a meticulously curated dataset comprising 403 images categorized into distinct classes of ants and bees. The key highlights of the project are outlined below:

Key Features:
Data Augmentation: Utilizes the ImageDataGenerator from TensorFlow's Keras API for data augmentation, enhancing the model's ability to generalize and recognize diverse patterns.
Sequential Augmentation: Implements a sequential model for data augmentation, including operations such as horizontal flipping, random rotation, and random zoom, introducing variability into the training dataset.
Integration with the Model: Integrates the data augmentation model seamlessly into the main classification model. Augmentation is applied to the images in real-time during training, enhancing the model's exposure to varied patterns.
Model Architecture:Employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with three Conv2D layers, strategically designed for effective feature extraction. The model is structured with additional layers such as max-pooling, dropout, and dense layers for optimal performance.
